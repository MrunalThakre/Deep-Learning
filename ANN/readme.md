# Insurance Cost Prediction with ANN

This repository contains a project to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the cost of insurance.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Model Development
Design and develop an ANN model with the following considerations:
- Experiment with Perceptron
- Experiment with different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

### 3. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Experiment with:
- Different numbers of epochs
- Different learning rates
- Different batch sizes

### 5. Optimizers
Apply and compare the performance of the following optimizers:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Momentum Based Gradient Descent
- Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent

### 6. Comparative Analysis
Provide a comparative analysis of the model's performance with different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.

### 7. Model Saving
Save the trained ANN model for future use.
