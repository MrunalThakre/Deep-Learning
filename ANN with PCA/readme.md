# Handwritten Digit Classification with ANN

This repository contains a project to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict handwritten digits using a digit classification dataset.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Identify the appropriate number of principal components.
- Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

### 3. Model Development
Design and develop an ANN model to classify handwritten digits.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics before and after applying PCA.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
Provide a comparative analysis of the model's performance with and without PCA.

### 6. Model Saving
Save the final trained ANN model for future use.
