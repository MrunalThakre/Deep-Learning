# Accident Severity Prediction with ANN

This repository contains a project to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the severity of accidents.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Model Development
Design and develop an ANN model with the following considerations:
- Experiment with different numbers of epochs
- Try different learning rates
- Experiment with batch sizes
- Apply optimizers: AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam

### 3. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

### 4. Runtime Chart
Display a runtime chart to visualize the training process.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
Provide a comparative analysis of the model's performance with different hyperparameters and optimizers.

### 6. Model Saving
Save the trained ANN model for future use.
