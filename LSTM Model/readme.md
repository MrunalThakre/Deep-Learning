# Google Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This repository contains a project to develop an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict Google's stock price for the open value.

## Project Overview

### 1. Model Development
Design and develop an LSTM model to predict Google's stock open prices.

### 2. Experimentation
Experiment with the following parameters to optimize the model:
- Split ratio for training and testing data
- Time stamp value (window size for input sequences)
- Number of LSTM layers
- Number of neurons in each LSTM layer

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow or keras
